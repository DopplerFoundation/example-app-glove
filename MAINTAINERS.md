# Companion Words

## App Design
This app uses the pretrained word vectors generated by the GloVe model described in Stanford's paper, ["GloVe: Global 
Vectors for Word Representation"][1]. The pretrained word vectors can be found at the accompanying website, 
[nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove][2].

The model is trained on the Twitter dataset, a dataset of 2 billion tweets resulting in 27 billion tokens.

## Contributing
Code should be written for Python 3, include documentation (docstrings & comments), follow PEP 8 and pass all unittests.
To run the unittests, simply run `python -m unittest` from the repo directory.
